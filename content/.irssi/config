#This needs to be changed before it will work - in place of #channel put a
#channel name, in place of irc.freenode,2,3.org put the name of your server, in
#place of freenode,2,3 put the name you want the server to be known as.  Make
#sure you keep these consistant throughout the config.  Remember to change the
#realname and nick values too.  Hilights will also need to be set.  This config
#will autoconnect to 3 servers and 7 channels.  For more just copy and paste the
#relevant details and change the values. For more information please see 
#http://irssi.org or please email me at irssi@carina.org.uk
